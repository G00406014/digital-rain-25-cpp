A Project in Modern C++ cpp coding project

The Digital Rain Project is a modern C++ project that visually represents falling raindrops,

## Software Design, Architechture & test

I went with the design of object-oriented code for this project. I chose object-oriented code because
it promotes modularity and reusability, letting me group related data and functions together in classes. 
Additionally, using constructors ensures that each object is initialized properly, enhancing reliability.
Constructors allow for setting default values and establishing the initial state of an object, which is crucial for preventing errors.
This approach also simplifies debugging and testing.

The first thing i attempted was to print Hello vertically, this code snippet :

  By being able to print hello veritcally going down my screen it gave me confidence that i can use
  letters and numbers to visually simulate digital rain. Here is an example of me printing random 
  numbers vertically.

  After being able to print out charachters and number vertically, i choose to go with using ASCII charachters on the tabe within the range of 33 - 126,
  which is a mix of numbers, upper and lowercase charachters and symbols, this diversity allows for a visually engaging representation of digital rain

  The available symbols from the ASCII table :

  After implemening the ASCII table to my project, the next solution was to be able to print out the range of characters randomly.
  To achieve this, I utilized the C++ random library, which provides tools for generating random numbers.

  I set up a random number generator using std::mt19937 and std::uniform_int_distribution<> to ensure that each character printed was selected from the specified ASCII range, each 
  time my rain simulation was running. 

  To vertically print, i was using the function gotoxy, positioning each character vertically down the console window, this was to create the illusion of falling rain drops.
  I also implemented an animation loop that would constantly update the positions of characters, by periodically clearing the screen and re-printing characters in their new positions
  this achievd a smooth visual transition. 

  For testing i have a function called TestRandomNumberGenerator, in this test it will 

## Algorithms
I am using algorithms in several places with in my code, The first algorithm i am going to talk about is
: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcf3c05b-2794-4197-89d3-ebf4d1c30b08)

This code snippet is of my Random Number Generation algorithm, this algorithm ensures that
each and every raindrop is unique and will behave unpredicatably, making for a realistic digital 
rain effect.

std::random_device rd;

std::mt19937 eng(rd());

This part of the code is responsible for seeding and initalizing the random number generator.

std::uniform_int_distribution<> distrX(0, SCREEN_WIDTH - 1);

std::uniform_int_distribution<> distrY(0, SCREEN_HEIGHT - 1);

This part of the code generates a random X & Y for the raindrop.


## Problem Solving
 One of the problems I was previously experincing fickering issues when running my simulation of digital rain, I wanted to improve transitions, to resolve this 
 issue
 i implemented Vectors. Snippet of old code :
 
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76a8fbca-afb7-4c92-9f79-6afd25b7549e)

 This code was only updating one column at a time, meaning the rest of the screen was static between updates.
 You could also see a kind of visual blink when this code ran each time : system("cls")). This approach was wrong as it was clearing the whole screen, which
 was resulting in flickering.

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6940365e-2792-4b72-a31a-692001a2f7c2)

 By switching to a vector-based approach which stores a dynamic collection of RainDrop objects., I was able to update all active raindrops simultaneously. This 
 allowed for a much smoother transitions
 and eliminated the need to clear the screen entirely each time. Since vectorâ€™s are dynamic this allowed me to handle multiple raindrops more efficiently,
 creating a much more apealing visual.
 
 This change significantly reduced the flickering and improved the overall performance and visual quality of the simulation.

 

## Modern C++ insight & reflection
- at this point i was still using srand but that is not the practice of a modern
  C++ programmer, so i instead decided to use the <random> library, I avoided to use srand() because
  it's outdated, has poor randomness and is not thread safe, these are all features i want to avoid
  having in my code.
