# Digital Rain - Modern C++ Project

**Tags**: C++, Coding, Project

**Categories**: Demo, C++ Programming

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a visual simulation of falling raindrops that are represented by ASCII characters. The simulation is built using object-oriented programming principles, which makes the code reusable and easy to maintain.

## Features

- **Randomized Raindrop Behavior**: Each raindrop falls at different speeds and appears at random positions, making the effect visually dynamic.
- **ASCII Characters**: Random characters are chosen for each raindrop, enhancing the aesthetic.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Code is structured in classes to promote reusability and maintainability.
