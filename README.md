# digital-rain-25-cpp


A Project in Modern C++ cpp coding project
--
The Digital Rain Project is a modern C++ project that visually represents falling raindrops,
//think about adding a try catch, exexution 

## Software Design, Architechture & test
- Design
## Algorithms
I am using algorithms in several places with in my code, The first algorithm i am going to talk about is

This code snippet is of my Random NUmber Generation algorithm, this algorithm ensures that
each and every raindrop is unique and will behave unpredicatably, making a realistic digital 
rain effect. 

## Algorithms Development
